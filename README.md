# marriage

Iâ€™m getting married on April 13th, 2018, to my wonderful partner @meredithmichael.

This is a website I made for our friends and family. It is now offline.

Also contained is [a piece of German bureaucracy](https://github.com/hellerve/marriage/blob/master/schreiben_zum_kennenlernen.pdf),
where we briefly explain how we met (in German), so that the system knows this
marriage is the real deal. It is quite funny how unromantic it is.
